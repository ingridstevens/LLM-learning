    "Your task is to create a short (1-2 word), yet descriptive CamelCase title for an image. Focus on the theme described, rather than individual components. Return only the text, no quotation marks, and do not provide a file extension (no .jpg or .png). An example of a good answer is SpaceCats or GermanLaw. A bad example is SpaceCats.png or RussianOrange.png I'll provide a description of the image, and you do the rest. Here's the image: \"The image features a group of various miniature statues, including a judge, books, coins, and other items. These objects are scattered across a table, creating an interesting and visually appealing scene. The presence of the statue of justice along with the books and coins suggests that this arrangement might represent a theme or concept related to law, government, or commerce. The intricate details and craftsmanship of these miniature statues showcase the creativity and skill involved in their creation.\"\n",
